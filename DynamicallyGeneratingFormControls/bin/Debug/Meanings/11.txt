The Wheel Of Fortune 

[intepretation]
The wheel of fortune spins in the direction of good fortune and luck. 

[reversed]
The universe hands you out a dish of bad luck - careful not to ask for seconds. 

[symbols+images]
Once again the Ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life is held in the hands of the spinner of the wheel. The card deals with issues of the circle/cycle of life and the constant motion. Here the holder of the Ankh is happy for the good fortune that life has presented to him.
The actual wheel is adorned with the letters TARO and the Hebrew letters of Yod, Heh, Vav, and Heh - unpronounceable consonants that made God's "true" name unpronounceable. The wheel also houses the head of the jackal, representing Anubis, the son of Set and the guide to souls of the underworld. While the snake represents Set himself as the god of Evil.
The strong symbols within the wheel are contrasted with the symbols of the cycle of life outside the wheel - the Angel (Spring), the Lion (Summer), the Bull (Autumn) and the Eagle (Winter).


On the reverse side of the spinner of the wheel is defiant and struggling to gain control of the wheel. The universe has dealt him a bad run of luck and he vainly tries to spin the wheel in hope for better luck.
