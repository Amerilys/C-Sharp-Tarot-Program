The Devil 

[intepretation]
Material things, pleasures and lust and desire drive him. 

[reversed]
He abuses his power. He is trapped by the lure of money. He only cares for the fulfillment of his own desires. 

[symbols+images]
The devil is drawn as a well-dressed charmer here to indicate the power of illusion.
The background and foreground show the trappings of material things, which keep him occupied.

The golden wheel in the foreground show two people tied up in bondage indicating sexual fantasies and role-playing. The devil plays towards the pleasures enjoyed by the flesh whether it be from pain or from tenderness.

The background on the reverse side is highlighted by a flash of lightning which plays towards the notion of abuse of power - which may lead to sudden destruction of those material things, which are held precious.
