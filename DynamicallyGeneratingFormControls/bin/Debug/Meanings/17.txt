The Tower 

[intepretation]
There is a change in the wind, which will bring forth new beginnings. 

[reversed]
A tornado is about to tear everything apart and nothing in it's path will be the same. 

[symbols+images]
The tower is composed of panels and sheets representing the multiple elements that when brought together can create a larger structure. But just as easily as how one item is constructed in parts, it can be deconstructed in parts too.
The upside of the card shows that the tower construction is in a state of flux - neither forming nor breaking apart. The lightning symbolizes a dramatic surge of energy, which has changed the forces around the tower. Panels fly away from formation burning.

The reversed side illustrates the dramatic destruction of the tower. Lightning has definitely broken through and there will no longer be any tower. Change, and a destructive on at it, seems inevitable.
