The Magician 

[intepretation]
He brings together all elements as he is the catalyst of for all. He is the energy, which drives, the one who sparks interest. He is charming, he is witty and he is at home with the world around him. 

[reversed]
Outside forces hold him back. He is unable to channel his energy. He is distracted or blinded by other things. 

[symbols+images]
The dove represents the freedom of creation, which can come from within.
The hands in the background are representation of outside forces, which control and affect the paths and choices the magician takes. The upside had is open with palm facing towards the sky - expression release, the release of self. The hand on the reverse represents an expression of constriction and control - holding the magician back from his full potential.

The staves of the magicians contrast between the control one has over the energies in their lives. The upside magician utilizes a stiff and straight staff, a representation of the sureness of his direction and conviction of his power. The reversed magician utilizes a crooked staff from a fallen branch - a representation of the haphazard nature of his mind and powers.
The gestures of the magician's hands holding the staves points to their direction - of moving forwards or dwelling on the situation for too long.

He carries all four elements of the minor arcana - the sword for wind, the wand for fire, the cup for water and the pentacle for earth. He has command over these elements. 

The varying green background represents the deep relationship the magician has with nature in all its seasons.
