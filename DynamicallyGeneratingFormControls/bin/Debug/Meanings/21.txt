Judgement 

[intepretation]
Hear the trumpets calling - heed the blaring sounds. Answer the call of the awakening sounds of the universe. 

[reversed]
The deafening sounds cannot be avoided, the constant beckoning cannot be ignored. 

[symbols+images]
The angel of judgment represents the call from a higher source. A choir of angels accompanies the sound of the trumpet. The message is of a life after death.
The man in the middle opens his arms wide to accept this new stage in his (after)life. He is naked, as all beings are born and as they shall die.

The angel blares his call but the man covers his ears to hide from the sound. The choirs of angels sing in vain. The man does not want to move on from the grave of his fate.
