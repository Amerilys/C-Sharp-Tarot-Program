The World 

[intepretation]
Things will come around a full circle 

[reversed]
There is a bumpy road along the journey of the circle 

[symbols+images]
The World card is very similar to the Wheel of Fortune as it plays on the theme of things coming to full circles and of completion. 
The two dancers hold on to two wands (for balance of the element of creation, fire) - each flying a purple flag (the colour of divinity) and dance upon the serpent, which represents the world.

Surrounding the wreath of laurel leaves, are once again the four symbolic representations of the seasons and the elements: the lion head for summer and fire; the bull head for autumn and earth, the angel head for spring and air; and the eagle head for winter and water.

The deep blues and purples of the background blends into the darkness of space, where stars shine the brightness. This is the world set within the universe - where everything begins and end, a full circle.
