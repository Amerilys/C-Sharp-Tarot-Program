Ace Of Cups 

[intepretation]
The cup overflows with emotions of joy, happiness and friendships 

[reversed]
The contents have spilt as the cup empties. The vessel only represents what there could have been. 

[symbols+images]
The ornate cup represents the preciousness of the vessel, the holder of water, being the metaphor of emotions. The vessel is much like the body precious in its own right and beautiful to the beholder of the eye - inside it holds the emotions of the being, both good and bad.
