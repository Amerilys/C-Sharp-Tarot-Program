Two Of Cups 

[intepretation]
Together they entwine in an understanding of partnership and commitment. 

[reversed]
They can't see eye to eye and stand to lose everything if they continue this way 

[symbols+images]
The card has always been viewed as the lesser version of the Major Arcana's Lovers.
Here the partnerships seem less about two people being together for love and more for an object or project.
The cups symbolize their commitment to be together.
In the background a guardian/sentinel watches over their union, representing a higher level or force, which plays a role in forming the partnership.

In the background on the reverse the sentinel has his hands up in the air, appealing to a higher power than itself for sake of the union.
The mer-people have their backs to each other and are so caught up in their own pride and ego that they careless for the cup, the symbol of their partnership.
