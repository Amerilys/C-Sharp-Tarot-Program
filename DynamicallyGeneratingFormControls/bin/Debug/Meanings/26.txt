Four Of Cups 

[intepretation]
She lays back pondering and waiting. She does not move or care for offerings around her. 

[reversed]
She grasps the situation and the opportunities presented 

[symbols+images]
The cards follow the idea of stability and the rut may be associated. The mermaids are both presented with the same emotional possibilities but one takes them while the other is so lost within herself that she cannot see them.
The upside mermaid plays with her hair in her boredom while waiting for something better to come along. As she sinks slowly towards the bottom of the ocean floor on the nautilus shell, she does not notice the offering of cups to her, or the dangers of the free tentacles, which may entwine around her. Her complacency does not make her aware of both opportunity and danger around her.

The reverse side mermaid ceases the opportunity and takes on the cups. She does not stay around long enough for the tentacles to grab on and hold her back.
