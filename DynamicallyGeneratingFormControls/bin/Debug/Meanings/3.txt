The High Priestess 

[intepretation]
She patiently waits for things to unravel. She is in control of all things in her life. While the world around her moves in constant motion, she stands firm in her ground of logic and intuition to guide her through.

[reversed]
Things are hidden behind masks. More things lie beneath the facades and superficial appearances of the situation. Be aware and be ready to take the time to unravel the mysteries. 

[symbols+images]
The priestess has no real body illustrated but the continual unraveling and wrapping of a ribbon cloth define her from. This illustrates that great power that she holds in the controlling of the elements around her to create both a presence and a mystery.
The scroll in her hand represents the knowledge she holds firmly in her grasp. It remains a secret and is read only by her and her kind.
The moon represents the triad of womanhood, the girl, the woman and the crone. The images of pomegranates and shapes in the back herald fertility and the issues relating to the core of her womanhood.
The masks of different shapes and sizes reinforce the notion of the mystery of the unknown - sometimes a pleasant surprise, other times of unforeseen dangers. The deep blues and purples play on the idea of the darkness of night and the reflective depths of still water.
