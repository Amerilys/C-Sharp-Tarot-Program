Eight Of Cups 

[intepretation]
Away he swims from the troubles of his life. He moves on and abandons all that he has achieved in the search for meaning, happiness and contentment. 

[reversed]
She is trapped within her own depression, anxiety and hopelessly. She can't see past her emotions and floats amongst the ruins of her life. 

[symbols+images]
The boldness of the merman as his pushes through the barrier of the cups evokes a movement and a sense of drive towards the light.

The long flowing hair of the mermaid reflects upon the time she has spent there in that moment, still and without activity. She closes her eyes to hide away from the reality around her. She sits comfortably amongst the rocks as she does not want to move on.

Colour: colour of the oceans, blues - associated with Pieces
