Ten Of Cups 

[intepretation]
Happiness is found within the family and those whom are dear. 

[reversed]
Quarrels and unrest disrupts the home environment. Those who seem close are now more distant. 

[symbols+images]
The lights from above illuminates upon the happy family who have contentment within their lives.
The children play without any worry in the world symbolizing the innocence of youth and the enjoyment of simpler pleasures.

The merman leaves the mermaid and heads off into the darkness - symbolizing the unknown. She lays there in despair their home broken from an argument. The separation ruins the original happy image.
