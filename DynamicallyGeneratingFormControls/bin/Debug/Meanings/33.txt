Page Of Cups

She is the student of the cup.
The two ornate fishes, which circle her, are her familiars - the Piscean pair. They heighten her awareness on an intuitive level.

The reversed side Page dives blindly to the bottom of the ocean floor, proving her skills and intuitive gifts. However she fails to "see" the dangers of the tentacles around her prize, which will keep her down forever.
Her brashness nature and heavy influence of her emotions will cause her more hurt than good.
