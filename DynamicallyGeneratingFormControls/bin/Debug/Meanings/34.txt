Knight Of Cups 

[intepretation]
He is a sensitive gentle soul and a dreamer. A hopeless romantic who awaits for love. 

[reversed]
He is removed from his emotions. He turns a blind eye towards them and remains despondent and aloof. 

[symbols+images]
The knight carries with him an ornate cup, which represents the ideal of the holy grail. The cup he holds close to him as it contains what he deems as precious to his life, his emotions and feelings. He uses them wisely and carefully.
He looks into the cup as his guide. His movement is through the interpretations of his emotions and where they will take him.

The reverse side knight barely holds onto his cup. It is of no importance to him. His arms are crossed for his he refuses to budge or to take responsibility for neither his emotions nor his feelings.

Colour: gold and red - colours for a coat of arms and of movement
