King Of Cups 

[intepretation]
He rules the currents of the soul, he is the keeper of the waters. He has an unrivaled imagination, he is the source of creativeness, he charms the heart with his understanding and intuition. 

[reversed]
He can not tear himself away from his emotions, they rule him and his heart. He embodies depression, sorrow and abuses his substances to escape from it all. 

[symbols+images]
The regal merman on the shell-like throne represents the man at ease within himself. He has a comfortable smile on his face and is surrounded by lush greens and life of the ocean floor. 
The Piscean pair dance around him. They represent the presence of his intuitive and empathic nature. 

The reversed merman king represents a man who can not let go of his cup - the source of his problems. 
Behind him are the tentacles of a creature that slowly sways around him awaiting for a false move from him to take him down further on his path of destruction.

Colour: gold and blue - royalty and command.
