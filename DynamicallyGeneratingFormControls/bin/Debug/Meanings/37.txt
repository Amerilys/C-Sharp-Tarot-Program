Ace Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
Prosperity and abundance in all things physical and material. 

[reversed]
Material obsessions, and money vanish before you as a darkness casts a shadow over wealth and well being. 

[symbols+images]
the pentacles fan out in the pentagram format to reinforce the pattern of the design. The intricacy of the design is derived from Islamic and Celtic motifs, deeply rooting the infused design in a history of it's own.
