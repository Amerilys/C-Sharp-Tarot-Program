Two Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
She balances all her tasks and jobs in the perfect juggle 

[reversed]
She has lost control of her tasks and jobs. She desperately tries to keep them up in the air. 

[symbols+images]
The pentacles are entwined by a string which forms the infinity sign - symbolizing the same magic which can be found in the mastery of the Magician and the inner power of Strength.

Following the theme of balance, the female seems to hardly touch the balls which she juggles. These balls symbolize the many tasks and responsibilities we may find in daily life.

The reversed female is stressed and disturbed by her lack of balance. She has lost control over her balls and one by one they cause her more grief.

Colour: gold and greens - colour of the earth and of Capricorn'
