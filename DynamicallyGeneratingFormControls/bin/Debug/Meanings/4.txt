The Empress 

[intepretation]
She is mother of all things. She nurtures all within her grasp with her generous giving nature and her over abundance of joy. She brims full of life and life revolves around her. 

[reversed]
She is lost in the wilderness of despair. The joys of life escape her. She runs away from love and hides in the mountains and rock faces of loneliness. 

[symbols+images]
The warmth of the sun and the golden fields of wheat and grain indicate growth that surrounds her.
The background shows a waterfall cascading from a lush forest illustrating the gift of life flowing through nature. This water changes the path of life and erodes away at things of old. The flow of water represents change, which comes from the continual flow of life.
The warm hues add to the radiating beauty of the empress's kindness and joy as she basks in the glory of the sun.
Moon is in her background representing her connection with the symbol of womanhood. Stars crown her head for she is the mythological Ishtar/Eoster.
The world represents nature, which sits in her lap. She lays it under her bosom, for she is the mother of nature - she is Mother Nature. 

The dark purples and blues of the reversed side help mask the desolate background of her anguish.
The rain lines indicate a veil, which clouds her path to happiness. Nature has turned against her and she tries to seek refuge in the cover from life.
Her face is craved by the anguish of her tears and sorrow.
