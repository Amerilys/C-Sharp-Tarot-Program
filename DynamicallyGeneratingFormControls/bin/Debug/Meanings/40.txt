Four Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
He holds on to his money with his life. Nothing is more paramount than the security it provides him. 

[reversed]
The money he has surrounded himself with has blinded him. He spends it only on himself and dances in his own wealth. 

[symbols+images]
The piercing glare of the man is deathly cold and glazed with out a soul. He holds on to the pentacle with obsession and fear of loss. It covers him and shields him from all. 
The use of gold on his skin is scarce and limited, reflecting the ultra-conservative nature he expresses.

The reversed man is driven to a state of lack of coherence. He spends because he knows not of the value anymore. He is driven to only the comforts of his own needs.
In contrast the colour of gold is abundant on the skin of the man, expressing his exuberant nature.
