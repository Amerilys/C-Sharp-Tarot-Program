Ten Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
Within tradition and family comes support 

[reversed]
The old man stares back as us reminding us of the coin and the burdens of and responsibilities to tradition 

[symbols+images]
The family all around the old man reflects of the importance of tradition and respect to elders. They look upon him (and hold on to him) for he is the anchor of their pasts.
The surrounding environment plays to the image of a wealthy household - stability through "old" money.

The reversed shows the old man holding the coin up as if for ransom or to serve as a reminder. The image plays to the concept of enforced responsibility to the burdens of tradition and respect to the old ways.
