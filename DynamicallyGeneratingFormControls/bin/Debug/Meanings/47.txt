Page Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
She is fixated by the pentacle as she sees it and through it. 

[reversed]
She is done with the pentacle as she begins to disassemble it - only to reassemble it again. 

[symbols+images]
All around the Page things are in flux and in movement towards the formation of something. The background plays towards the concept of bringing things together. In this case it is through the focus and magic of the Page as she wills all around her to do her bidding.

The background shows a dense forest of autumn trees which has lost their leaves. The idea of wilderness and wild plays on the theme of unorthodox, as the Page pulls apart the pentacle with ease indicating a complacency with the object.

Colour: gold and purple - colour of royalty
