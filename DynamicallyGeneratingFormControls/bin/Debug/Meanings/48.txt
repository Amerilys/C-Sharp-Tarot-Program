Knight Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
He is determined to work to reach his goals. His focus drives him only to work hard and to ride his ambitions to fruition 

[reversed]
He finds it hard to carry on his journey. All the hard work and trudging has driven his energies low and he looses confidence in himself. He holds on to his goals but his energies are low. 

[symbols+images]
The large knight sits on his equally robust horse. The two of them an image of strength and stability. The firm determination in his eyes reflects his unwavering focus on his goals. 
The background lies city for his taking and a large pillar of support.

The reversed knight is having a moment to collect himself. He grieves from his tired efforts. His horse turns away and moves on even if he still has no direction or control over it.
The background only shows of faded shapes reflecting the lack of focus. The pattern on the pillar behind him breaks apart slowly.

Colour: gold and red - colour of the coat of arms and movement
