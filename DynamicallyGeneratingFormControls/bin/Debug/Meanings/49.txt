Queen Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
She is a warm hearted woman surrounded by luxury and wealth. She gives from her wholesome heart for the pleasures of the body 

[reversed]
She is wild like the wind and cares for nothing but herself. Everything is about her, for her and to be done by her. 

[symbols+images]
The queen here is like the lesser version of the empress. She too has the world at her grasp as she is one with nature and at one with all those around her. Her gentle and trusting gaze shows the kindness in her heart.
She is flanked by two pillars of support and crowned by a throne of roses reflecting her caring nature and natural beauty.

The reversed queen is moved by the wind. Much like her, it is a force of nature which can cause destruction as it travels through the lives of many. She consumes for pleasure and her own enjoyment.
She is barely covered indicating the ease she has within herself of her own body and the ease which others may have to it too. 

Colour: gold and green - the colour of royalty and of healing and nature
