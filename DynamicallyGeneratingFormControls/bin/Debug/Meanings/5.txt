The Emperor 

[intepretation]
He is the ruler of all. He holds power effortlessly in his hands. He commands. He controls. He dominates. 

[reversed]
Others are in control. He is but a puppet in play - he has no say. 

[symbols+images]
Aries is his ruling sign. He is the ambitious leader, the instigator of all things new. He is dominant and is war-like in his leadership. The Ram adorns his shoulder dress armor, it adorns his throne.
Purple, the colour of royalty, is lavishly used to affirm his position.
The city in the background is mirrored by the mountains on either side showing his dominance over both issues of man and of nature. There is no mountain too high he cannot control, nor is that no city to wide for him to reign over.
He holds an Ankh in his hands - the Egyptian symbol for life, of which he rules over.
The moon contrasts the empress who basks in the sun. Here the moon is nothing more than a source of light.

The strings, which control him in the reverse, are illuminated to represent that they are invisible. He is one of many who are controlled by a higher power.
Here the reversed emperor is the powerless. His stare is blank and soulless.
