King Of Pentacles 

[intepretation]
He holds himself back upon his sturdy throne. He is grounded, in control of himself and enjoys the luxuries that life has to offer 

[reversed]
He is the stick in the mud which doesn\'t move but stays there - willingly. His face wears boredom like a second skin as he grumbles and moans. 

[symbols+images]
The throne is adorned with hard woods and bull head capitals, indicating a closeness to earth and Taurus. The card is rich in materialism and comforts produced from the earth. The king has a firm face and a collected pose for he is man of no nonsense or of flamboyancy. He is sturdy, robust and stable and rules his life that way.

The reverse king is lounging in boredom. Materials and riches do nothing for him. He is out of touch with his responsibilities and concerns.
The throne is adorned with autumn leaves indicating the passing of summer and towards a cold winter. The transition period from a joyous time to one of caution and need for material comforts.

Colour: gold and blue - royalty and command
