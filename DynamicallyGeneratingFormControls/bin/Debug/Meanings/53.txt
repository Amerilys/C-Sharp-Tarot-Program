Three Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He lays there in does his crying in the rain. He wallows in the sorrow of his heart ache 

[reversed]
He cries out to the skies from his anxiety. His mind is a playing field for chaos. He suffers extreme anguish from mental and emotional stress. 

[symbols+images]
The card depicts two different ways of dealing with heartache and sorrow. One lies in defeat upon a sword, the feeling of self pity clouding judgment as he runs his arm along the edge of the sword. He lays there feeling sorry for himself, lost in his own anguish.

The reverse is a focused image on the unleashing of great sorrow and anger which comes form the stresses within. The scream a released which frees the body of all it's tension.
