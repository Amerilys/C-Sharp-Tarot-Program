Four Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He finds rest for recuperation 

[reversed]
Rest is enforced upon him as he did not heed to do so in the first instance 

[symbols+images]
The card plays on the notion of rest - of the mental kind. Here stress from life, situation or the environment may require one to take some time out and rest. In the case of the reversed side, rest was not taken when required which has led to enforced rest.

Colour: electric blues, turquoise - associated with Aquarius
