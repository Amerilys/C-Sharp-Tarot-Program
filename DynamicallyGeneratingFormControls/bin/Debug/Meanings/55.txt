Five Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He performs the ritual of suicide as a result of his failure. 

[reversed]
Great sorrow is wept from her eyes as she grieves a great loss and failure of her own accord. 

[symbols+images]
The Japanese themed images reflect upon the magnitude of which failure can cause upon ones psyche. 
The "hara kiri"-esque ritual of suicide through dishonor or failure adds a certain dimension of a mental process which had to be played out before performing the actual act. It is calculated and planned, and not merely an emotional reaction.

The reversed side shows a Japanese woman in deep mournful sorrow. Here her despair is related to the death of the man on the upside.

Colour: electric blues, turquoise - associated with Aquarius
