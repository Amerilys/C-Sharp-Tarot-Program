Six Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He pushes through waters of life taking with him only his wits. He is on a journey away from a place where his skills were not utilized 

[reversed]
The journey is difficult, the waters are rough - he pushes through as hard as he can manage. 

[symbols+images]
The card is about a journey away. The swords represent a mental journey. A condition of the mind which may need to change internally or with the help of external influence.
The transparent vessel is meant to indicate the delicate nature of the transition. A fragile boat of glass requires skillful and slow movement to prevent its bow from breaking against a crashing rock.

The reversed side man experiences difficulty through the could of fog and the torrent of waves. The journey will be difficult as he attempts to stay anchored with his oar to prevent himself from being swept astray.

Colour: electric + deep blues - associated with Aquarius
