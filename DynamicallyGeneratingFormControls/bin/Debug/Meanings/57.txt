Seven Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He chuckles at his victim\'s stupidity as he walks away with yet another bundle of stolen goods. 

[reversed]
He is crafty with his words and clever with his lies. He hides under a mask of sincerity. Represents all things superficial and false. 

[symbols+images]
Because the card is one of swords, both images represent the theft or lies associated with thought and the mind. The swords may represent ideas which are stolen or the wasting or effort and mental capacity with the situation.

The reversed side has the man covered or flanked by swords, representing the shallow use of thought or ideas to project the wrong image or concept. 
His hands in a mock prayer as he bows forward with his superficial smile. He aims to please, but only for his own gain.

Colour: bi-coloured, warm hues, yellows - associated with Gemini
