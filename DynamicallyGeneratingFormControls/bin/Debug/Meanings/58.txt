Eight Of Swords 

[intepretation]
She binds herself in a velvet rope. She feigns entrapment of her own accord. 

[reversed]
She frees herself only to see the error of her ways. 

[symbols+images]
The swords she lays upon pose no direct threat to her. Here the swords represent issues which torment her mind - the lay in the background, a threat to her, but indirectly.
She holds on to the ropes as she tries to bind herself harder. The ropes are holding her back from dealing with the situation, but she chooses to hold on to them.
The blindfold is her excuse from seeing situation as it is.

The reversed image shows her freeing herself from the binding and the blindfold. She has liberated herself without the help of others.

Colour: bi-coloured, warm hues - associated with Gemini.
