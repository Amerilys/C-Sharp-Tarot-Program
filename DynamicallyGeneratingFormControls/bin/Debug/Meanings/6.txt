The Heirophant 

[intepretation]
He is the maker and follower of rules. He is a man of routine. He has his processes, his plans, and his routines. He helps all that he can through structured guidance. He is removed from his surroundings.

[reversed]
He is unorthodox. He marches to a different tune. Guides the way, but through an unconventional path. He is at one with his surroundings. 

[symbols+images]
The symbols of the staff and the keys relate to the pope and the structure associated with organised religion.
The symbol of Taurus is formed between the keys - the sign of Taurus represents the house of materialism, worldly possessions, and security.
His fingers point up, drawing attention to a high power and the teachings, which come from above.
He is adorned in the symbolic luxury of the church - the golden headdress, the purple robes. The background is floating montage of stain glass. Both these images reinforce the structure and rigidity, which accompany years of tradition of the church. 

The druid like man on the reverse is points to the side, indicating the idea of the "other" or all around as a source of knowledge.
He wears robes coloured of clay and of earthen tones, drawing association to his relationship with the earth.
The background has a faint mosaic formation of a pentagram - reflecting the teachings of paganistic/unorthodoxed traditions.
He does not look directly at us, instead to the side encouraging to find our own paths instead of following his own.
