Ten Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He lies in a pool of blood from being stabbed ten times. He now knows of a defeat so extreme or as definite 

[reversed]
He remains defiant even till his end, always looking upwards for hope 

[symbols+images]
The idea of being taken down by swords represents the metaphor of being ruined by slander and by bad reputation - pain inflicted by words or ideas.
His pale green skin has lost its colour, as he has long accepted this fate. His faced covered to hide his shame.

The card does pose a positive side to it though - once you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up. 
The reversed side shows a man pierced as well, but his fists are clenched and his head turned upwards-indicating defiance against the situation. 
The warning there is takes the situation and to turn it on it's head and keep fighting back.
