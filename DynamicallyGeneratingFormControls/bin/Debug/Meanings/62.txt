Knight Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He confidently flies across the sky wielding his sword brashly against the wind. He knows of no fear and lives life to the fullest 

[reversed]
He is reckless with his life and of others. He doesn't care for anything and seeks excitement and enjoyment at any cost 

[symbols+images]
Both images play on the theme of riding a winged stallion - the metaphor of expressive thought or ideas which is required to be controlled or conquered in order to achieve this goal. 
The knight has no fear on either side of falling off the creature. He is in command of the element of wind and air, knowing no boundaries and expresses a freedom and ease of traveling through it. 

The reverse side shows a wilder stallion taking the knight for a ride. The knight does not care for taming the creature but rides on it recklessly - the metaphor for being unable to use knowledge or the mind without causing injury to himself.

Colour: gold and red - colours of the coat of arms
