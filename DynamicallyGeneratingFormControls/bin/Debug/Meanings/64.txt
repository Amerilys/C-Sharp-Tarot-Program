King Of Swords 

[intepretation]
He is intellectually keen and clear. His piercing gaze shows a depth of knowledge and understands that cuts through all who stand before him. He is firm in his decision as well as wise in his movements 

[reversed]
He is blinded by his own brilliance; he abuses his power as he wields the sword for his own gain. He cuts those before his path down and manipulates for his own gain. 

[symbols+images]
Similar to the queen, the concept of the king being a winged creature, lends to the metaphor of the wings representing a higher level of consciousness, which he has reached. The king wields his sword, the symbol for thought and intelligence, with a firm grip, using it as both a shield as well as a weapon.

The sword covering the reversed king's face indicates that he not only hides behind the weapon but also abuses it in ways of deception.
