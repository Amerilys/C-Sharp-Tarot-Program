Ace Of Wands 

[intepretation]
The fires of life are alight around the wand of inspiration. Here marks the birth of all creation. 

[reversed]
The energy of life is blocked and the difficult to unleash 

[symbols+images]
The Latin word Adflatus means to breath or inspiration. The scroll unleashes as the power of the stone embedded in the wand erupts - causing the energy around to illuminate. The wand represents the birth of raw energy and creation.

The scroll wraps itself around the reversed stone. The darker aspect of the side reflects upon the lack or blockage of energy with life.
