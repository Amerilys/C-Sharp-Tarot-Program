Three Of Wands

[symbols+images]
The three sages have come together in a circle to from a vortex for creation. They channel their energies to the heavens to spread over the land. The image illustrates the level of ease of which the energy of creation flows through their bodies.

Behind him the elements are blowing apart his world, creation chaos and confusion.
