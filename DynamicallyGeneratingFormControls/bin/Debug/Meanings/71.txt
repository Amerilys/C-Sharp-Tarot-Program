[reversed]
He who hesitates will lose 

[symbols+images]
This is a warrior who thrives on battle. He relishes the moments and laughs his enemies off as he fights them even at the edge of a cliff. Within him is the strength and energy to carry on.

The reversed warrior is clouded in the darkness of self-doubt. His hesitation, indecisiveness will cost him precious time to react. The card warns of being quick to decide and not to cease the moment.
He is distracted to not notice that his enemy will take advantage of his shortfall and attack by surprise.
