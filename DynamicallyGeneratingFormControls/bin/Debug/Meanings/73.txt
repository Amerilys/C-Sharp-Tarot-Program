Nine Of Wands 

[intepretation]
He finds the strength inside to carry on with the battle 

[reversed]
The battle has worn him down and he is close to defeat 

[symbols+images]
The dragons behind each character are familiars to each warrior, reflecting their inner energies - which are being summoned upon. The dragon looks fiercely back indicating a defiance, which is required to over come the situation, which has brought the warrior down.

The reversed dragon turns to its side and moves away. The man cannot summon the strength to face the situation and his face is drained of all energy to continue on.

Colour: royal purples and sapphire blues - associated with Sagittarius
