Ten Of Wands 

[intepretation]
He burdens ten wands ambitiously. He exerts immense control over them with the power from within 

[reversed]
He realizes that he has taken on too much a task, and the wands break out of formation 

[symbols+images]
The energy within the sage has reached it\'s full potential. He can now burden the task of bringing together ten wands together after years of training and experience. He has reached his peak.

The reversed sage loses control over the task. He has not reached the level that is required to burden the other wands and they break out of formation. The image warns of not overburdening oneself with a task, which is beyond their abilities
