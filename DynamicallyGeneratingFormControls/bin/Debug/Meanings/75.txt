[symbols+images]
The upside Page has discovered her ability to conjure. The ethereal dragon marks the birth of her powers. She reflects the beginning of lessons and training, which one has to take to fully comprehend and control their inner energy.

The reversed side Page is unable to channel her powers as she is trying too hard. Her frustration only compounds the situation and creates a further block. The card warns of taking slower steps and allowing the energy to flow outwards naturally.
