Knight Of Wands 

[intepretation]
He smolders of energy. He rides his dragon with confidence and daring 

[reversed]
He is not sure of his direction. He cannot be trusted to save his own life much less of others 

[symbols+images]
The Knight is sure of himself. His confidence is contagious; his charisma burns underneath his armor. 
He rides the dragon as if it was an extension of him. The dragon symbolizing the embodiment of the raw powers of creation and of wisdom. The control his has over the dragon also plays towards the metaphor of being command of the direction of his life, having firm leadership and being in awe of those around him.

The reversed side dragon turns away from the knight. The Knight has lost control over his ride and holds on uncertainty. This metaphor plays towards to loss of control over projects, life and self.
