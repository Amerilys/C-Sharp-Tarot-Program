Queen Of Wands 

[intepretation]
She is a caring woman who looks out for others and provides for all 

[reversed]
She is deviant, and tantalizing. She indulges in her own fantasies and plays out others for her own gains 

[symbols+images]
The dragon and lion on her throne are symbols of the wisdom and loyalty associated with the creatures.
Behind her, a sunflower crowns her, symbolizing the ever providing gift of the sun.
On her lap sits a white cat is her familiar. It protects her like the Lion to the lady of Strength. The white represents the purity of her power and her selflessness.

Two male slaves flank the reversed side queen. They represent her insatiable lust over the body and forewarns of unfaithfulness, affairs and of sexual indulgence. 
The weary eye of the dragon, which crowns her, reflects on her untrusting nature, which may lead to extreme jealously and deceitfulness.

Colour: gold and green - royalty and the colour of healing and nature
